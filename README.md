# Capping_Ver.1

Here is the page that I am creating for my client side of the our Carbon Emissions page.
I can see that react would be the way to go for real time updates especially if we are
making a site based off of users

the best way to start this file is to follow this guide on how to properly
clone a react page: https://itsjavascript.com/react-scripts-command-not-found#google_vignette

And if you don't know how to committ to a specifc branch here is a video just to do it properly:

The way to start the react page after you follow the instructiosn is to make two terminals inside
of VS code or whatever IDE you are using

you want to be inside of Capping_Ver.1 for both terminals

Terminal 1 (MongoDB api call):
cd api
npm start

Terminal 2 (React page):
cd views
npm start

please refer to the google doc for the .env file and the keys.js file
